1. Create IAM policy
2. Install the agent


# Unified Cloudwatch Agent
 - For virtuals servers (EC2 instances, on-premise servers)
 - To collect additional additional system-level metrics such as RAM, processes, used disk space, etc.
 - No logs from EC2 instance will be sent to Cloudwatch without using an agent
 - Centralised configuration via SSM Parameter Store or the agent
 - Needs correct IAM permissions
 - Default namespace for metrics collected by the Unified Agent is called CWAgent; this can be changed

 * procstat Plugin
    - collect metrics and monitor system utilisation of individual processes
    - processes can be monitored by:
        - pid_file - name of process ID(pid)
        - exe - process name filter(RegEx)
        - pattern - command lines used to start the process(RegEx)
    - metrics collected by procstat plugin begins with 'procstat' prefix
    Use Case:
     - Collect memory usage per process
     - Collect CPU time per process
